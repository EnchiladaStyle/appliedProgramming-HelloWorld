# Overview

This program displays "Hello World" In the console. This is to demonstrate that my programming tools are set up correctly and are ready to use. It also symbolizes a fresh start and the beginning of a journey.

To add a little of my own flare, I chose to add a variale "Cool" and set it to True. The rest of the program is conditional with that variable. Since the program is so cool, it runs properly.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate that the program is ready to be added to.

The Link below is a video demonstration of how the program works.
